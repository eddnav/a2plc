a2plc
====

Simple tool that transforms Android string XML files to Property files, hence the terrible name (Android to Property Localization Converter). Made as an exercise, has a long way to go.

# Installation

```
$ npm i a2plc -g
```

# Usage

```
// Single files
$ a2plc filename

// Folder
$ a2plc filename -f
```
